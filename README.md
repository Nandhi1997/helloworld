# My Experience using GitHub as a Beginner.
I have used GitHub for the first time as a beginner and here I have gone through the various issues for creating the new Repository account. Thus, I have went through the various online resources such as Google, YouTube webinars regarding the GitHub knowledge as well as instructions for creating the GitHub repository account.
I have got to know GitHub used for various purposes like we can track our ongoing as well as existing Projects so that anyone can access to those files from the GitHub profile which makes us easy to collaborate on projects. So that Team members can work on files and easily merge their changes in the master branch of the Project.
I have experienced in writing the markdown file like here I have added the project details by adding the Title of the project as well as its contents In the **Readme.md** file by saving through the commit changes. Later for Creating as well as Publishing the Project in the GitHub pages I have gone through the settings then pages where we can choose to publish from a different branch or Folder. Also we can select the Theme to customize our sites look and feel.
# Issues Faced during GitHub account creation and how Troubleshooting done.
I have chosen the docs folder on a branch as publishing source and there is no docs folder in the root of my repository on that branch. I have solved it from **troubleshooting** the issues, by moving the docs folder back to the root of my repository on the branch chosen during publishing the source as docs sometimes will be get deleted accidentally.
# Improvements to be made.
The Issues / Discussion Threads can be better organized, as a Beginner faced difficulty in navigating to find the basic information during the discussions.
